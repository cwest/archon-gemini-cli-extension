# Implementation Plan: Developer Experience Enhancements

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to refactor and enhance the project for a better developer and contributor experience. The focus is on codebase cleanup, improved documentation, and the integration of modern development tools.

## Requirements Summary
- **Codebase Cleanup:** Remove unused files and reorganize the project structure.
- **Developer Tooling:** Integrate a Python task runner for build, test, and lint tasks.
- **Documentation Overhaul:** Rewrite `README.md` for users and update `docs/contributing.md` for developers.
- **Code Quality:** Integrate `ruff` for linting and formatting via pre-commit hooks.
- **Documentation Structure:** Rename `requirements` to `PRDs` and implement a numbered prefixing scheme.

## Research Findings
### Best Practices
- **Task Runners:** `poethepoet` is a good choice for a task runner as it integrates directly with `pyproject.toml`, keeping the project configuration centralized. It can be installed with `uv` as a development dependency.
- **README:** A good `README.md` for a CLI tool should include clear installation and configuration steps, a list of commands, and a simple usage example.
- **Contributing Guide:** `docs/contributing.md` should provide a clear path for new contributors to get started with development, including setup, testing, and code style.

### Reference Implementations
- The existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` will be used as a reference for adding `ruff`.
- The current `README.md` and `docs/contributing.md` will be used as a base for the new documentation.

### Technology Decisions
- **Task Runner:** `poethepoet` will be used for task management, installed via `uv`.
- **Linter/Formatter:** `ruff` will be used for code quality.

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Structure and Cleanup
1. **Rename `requirements` directory to `PRDs`**
   - Description: Rename the `requirements` directory to `PRDs`.
   - Files to modify/create: Rename `requirements` directory.
   - Dependencies: None.
   - Estimated effort: 5 minutes.

2. **Implement Numbered Prefixing for PRDs and PRPs**
   - Description: Rename existing PRDs and PRPs to follow the new numbered prefixing scheme.
   - Files to modify/create:
     - `PRDs/initial-development.md` -> `PRDs/00-initial-development.md`
     - `PRDs/developer-experience-enhancements.md` -> `PRDs/01-developer-experience-enhancements.md`
     - `PRPs/initial-development.md` -> `PRPs/00a-initial-development.md`
     - `PRPs/implement-utility-commands-and-details.md` -> `PRPs/00b-implement-utility-commands-and-details.md`
   - Dependencies: Phase 1, Task 1.
   - Estimated effort: 10 minutes.

3. **Remove Unused Files**
   - Description: Remove `main.py` as it is unused.
   - Files to modify/create: Delete `main.py`.
   - Dependencies: None.
   - Estimated effort: 5 minutes.

### Phase 2: Developer Tooling and Code Quality
1. **Integrate `poethepoet`**
   - Description: Add `poethepoet` to `pyproject.toml` and configure tasks for build, test, and lint.
   - Files to modify/create: `pyproject.toml`.
   - Dependencies: None.
   - Estimated effort: 20 minutes.

2. **Integrate `ruff` into Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Description: Add `ruff` to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for linting and formatting.
   - Files to modify/create: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
   - Dependencies: None.
   - Estimated effort: 15 minutes.

### Phase 3: Documentation
1. **Rewrite `README.md`**
   - Description: Rewrite the `README.md` to be user-focused, including sections for prerequisites, installation, configuration, commands, and usage.
   - Files to modify/create: `README.md`.
   - Dependencies: None.
   - Estimated effort: 30 minutes.

2. **Update `docs/contributing.md`**
   - Description: Update the contributing guide with information on the new task runner, pre-commit hooks, and local development setup.
   - Files to modify/create: `docs/contributing.md`.
   - Dependencies: Phase 2, Task 1 & 2.
   - Estimated effort: 25 minutes.

## Codebase Integration Points
### Files to Modify
- `pyproject.toml`: Add `poethepoet` and its configuration.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Add `ruff`.
- `README.md`: Complete rewrite.
- `docs/contributing.md`: Update with new tooling and processes.

### New Files to Create
- None.

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- The project uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency management, and `poethepoet` will follow this pattern.
- The pre-commit configuration will follow the existing structure in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## Technical Design
### Task Runner Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)
```toml
[tool.poe.tasks]
build = "python src/build.py"
lint = "ruff check ."
format = "ruff format ."
test = "pytest"
```

## Dependencies and Libraries
- `poethepoet`: For task management.
- `ruff`: For linting and formatting.

## Testing Strategy
- The existing tests will be run using the new `poe test` command.
- The pre-commit hooks will be tested by making a commit.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `requirements` directory is renamed to `PRDs`.
- [ ] PRDs and PRPs are renamed with numbered prefixes.
- [ ] `main.py` is deleted.
- [ ] `poethepoet` is integrated with `build`, `lint`, `format`, and `test` tasks.
- [ ] `ruff` is integrated into pre-commit hooks.
- [ ] `README.md` is rewritten for users.
- [ ] `docs/contributing.md` is updated for contributors.

## Notes and Considerations
- The local development environment will need to be updated to use the new task runner.
- All contributors will need to install the new pre-commit hooks.
