# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Project Documentation

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to enhance the project's `README.md` and `docs/contributing.md` files. The goal is to improve clarity, provide more information for developers, and align the documentation with open-source best practices.

## Requirements Summary
- Update `README.md` with project badges, a dependencies section, and inline links.
- Update `docs/contributing.md` with a guide for testing GitHub Actions locally and add inline links.
- Ensure all documentation is clear, concise, and consistently formatted.

## Research Findings
### Best Practices
- Badges at the top of a `README.md` provide a quick visual summary of the project's status.
- Linking to dependencies and tools lowers the barrier to entry for new contributors.
- Providing local testing instructions for CI/CD workflows (like GitHub Actions) is crucial for developer efficiency and contribution quality.

### Reference Implementations
- **act:** The [official `act` documentation](https://github.com/nektos/act) provides clear instructions for installation and usage, which will be adapted for this project's contribution guide.
- **Badges:** Standard badge formats from [shields.io](https://shields.io/) will be used for consistency.

### Technology Decisions
- **act:** Chosen for running GitHub Actions locally due to its popularity and direct compatibility. It requires Docker, which will be noted as a prerequisite.
- **Markdown:** All documentation will be written in standard Markdown.

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: `README.md` Enhancements
1.  **Add Project Status Badges**
    -   **Description:** Add a section at the top of the `README.md` with badges for Build Status, License, Project Version, and Code Quality.
    -   **Files to modify/create:** `README.md`
    -   **Dependencies:** None
    -   **Estimated effort:** 30 minutes

2.  **Create Dependencies Section**
    -   **Description:** Add a new "Dependencies" section listing `uv` and `poethepoet` with links to their official sites.
    -   **Files to modify/create:** `README.md`
    -   **Dependencies:** None
    -   **Estimated effort:** 15 minutes

3.  **Add Inline Links to README**
    -   **Description:** Convert mentions of `Gemini CLI` and `Archon MCP` into inline Markdown links.
    -   **Files to modify/create:** `README.md`
    -   **Dependencies:** None
    -   **Estimated effort:** 15 minutes

### Phase 2: `docs/contributing.md` Improvements
1.  **Add GitHub Actions Local Testing Guide**
    -   **Description:** Create a new section explaining how to install and use `act` to test GitHub Actions locally. Include a note about the Docker dependency.
    -   **Files to modify/create:** `docs/contributing.md`
    -   **Dependencies:** None
    -   **Estimated effort:** 45 minutes

2.  **Add Inline Links to Contribution Guide**
    -   **Description:** Convert mentions of `uv` and `pre-commit` into inline Markdown links.
    -   **Files to modify/create:** `docs/contributing.md`
    -   **Dependencies:** None
    -   **Estimated effort:** 15 minutes

## Codebase Integration Points
### Files to Modify
-   `README.md`: To add badges, a new dependencies section, and inline links.
-   `docs/contributing.md`: To add a new section on testing GitHub Actions and inline links.

### New Files to Create
-   None

### Existing Patterns to Follow
-   The existing Markdown structure and writing style in both files will be maintained for consistency.

## Technical Design
This project involves documentation changes only. No architectural or code changes are required.

## Dependencies and Libraries
-   **act:** A dependency for developers wishing to test GitHub Actions locally. It is not a project dependency.

## Testing Strategy
-   All links added to the documentation will be manually verified to ensure they point to the correct and active websites.
-   The instructions for `act` will be tested to ensure they are accurate and easy to follow.

## Success Criteria
-   [ ] `README.md` contains status badges for Build, License, Version, and Code Quality.
-   [ ] `README.md` has a "Dependencies" section with links to `uv` and `poethepoet`.
-   [ ] `README.md` has inline links for `Gemini CLI` and `Archon MCP`.
-   [ ] `docs/contributing.md` has a new section for testing GitHub Actions locally with `act`.
-   [ ] `docs/contributing.md` has inline links for `uv` and `pre-commit`.
-   [ ] All new and updated documentation is clear, well-formatted, and grammatically correct.

## Notes and Considerations
-   The URLs for external tools and services may change over time. A periodic review of the documentation is recommended to fix broken links.
-   The version badge will need to be updated as part of the release process.
