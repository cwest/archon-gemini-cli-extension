## v0.2.0 (2025-10-26)


- üîß chore(config): configure commitizen to support emojis
- ‚ú® feat(ci): enhance sync and release workflows
- This commit introduces several improvements to the CI/CD pipelines:
- Sync Workflow Improvements:
- The sync workflow now continues even if the build step fails (e.g., due to pre-commit hooks modifying files), ensuring PRs are still created.
- Implemented an optimization to only run the expensive build/transform process when the `archon-example-workflow` directory in the upstream repository has actually changed.
- Added the current date to the automatically created Pull Request title and commit message for better traceability.
- Introduced `.archon_sync_state` to track the last synced commit hash.
- Release Automation:
- Added a `prepare-release.yml` workflow that can be manually triggered to bump the version (major/minor/patch) and update `CHANGELOG.md` using `commitizen`.
- Added a `tag-release.yml` workflow that automatically creates and pushes a git tag when a release preparation PR (with a specific commit message format) is merged into `main`.
- Added `RELEASE.md` to document the new automated release process.
- Other Changes:
- Added `commitizen` to development dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
- Updated `.gitignore` to include `.gemini/` and `.gemini-clipboard/`.
- üìù docs(readme): correct installation URL typo
- üìù docs(readme): fix broken links and improve formatting
- Corrected the links for the Gemini CLI, which were pointing to the GitHub repository instead of the official website (geminicli.com).
- Additionally, this commit:
- Adds a link to an external article explaining the concept of "Product Requirements Prompts" (PRPs).
- Improves overall readability by re-wrapping long lines and adjusting spacing.

## v0.1.0 (2025-10-20)


- ‚ôªÔ∏è refactor(build): robust poe tasks and ci consistency
- - Updates the poe build task to be a sequence that runs pre-commit after the python build script to ensure license headers are always applied.

- ‚ú® feat(project): initialize extension and build automation
- This commit establishes the foundational structure, source code, and automation pipelines for the Gemini Archon Workflow Extension. It implements the initial development plan outlined in the `PRPs/initial-development.md` document.
- The core of this commit is the automated build process which transforms the source `archon-example-workflow` into a functional Gemini CLI extension.
- Key additions include:
- - **Build Script (`src/build.py`):** A Python script that automates the entire conversion process. It ingests the source repository, transforms the Claude-specific context files into a unified `GEMINI.md`, and converts the command definition markdown files into the required `.toml` format.
- - **Generated Extension Files:**
  - `GEMINI.md`: The master context file that provides the Gemini model with the necessary personas and workflow instructions.
  - `commands/archon/*.toml`: The generated command definitions for the extension.
- - **CI/CD Automation (`.github/workflows/`):**
  - `ci.yml`: A continuous integration workflow that lints, builds, and verifies that the generated extension files are up-to-date and committed.
  - `release.yml`: Automates the creation of GitHub releases when a new version tag is pushed.
  - `sync.yml`: A scheduled workflow to automatically check the upstream Archon source repository for changes and create a pull request with updates.
- - **Project Configuration:**
  - `pyproject.toml` & `uv.lock`: Defines the Python project and its dependencies, managed by `uv`.
  - `gemini-extension.json`: The manifest file for the Gemini CLI extension.
  - `.gitignore`: Updated to exclude the cloned `archon_source` directory.
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Updated to standardize license headers.
- üìù docs(planning): add initial implementation plan
- Adds the detailed, research-validated implementation plan for the Gemini Archon Workflow Extension. This plan is based on the comprehensive requirements specification and outlines the project's architecture, phases, tasks, and automation strategy.
- üìù docs(project): add initial development requirements
- Adds the initial, empty `initial-development.md` file to track project requirements.
- üì¶ build(project): add initial .gitignore for Python projects
- Adds a standard .gitignore file tailored for Python projects. This includes patterns to ignore common Python artifacts, virtual environments, IDE-specific files, build outputs, and testing artifacts.
- üîß chore(init): Boilerplate for new Google open source project
