# PRD: Enhanced Project Documentation

## 1. Strategic Overview

### Project Mandate
To improve the developer experience and project presentation by updating the `README.md` and `docs/contributing.md` files to be more comprehensive, informative, and aligned with open-source best practices.

### Core Principles
- **Clarity:** Documentation should be easy to understand for all users and contributors.
- **Completeness:** Provide all necessary information for users to get started and for contributors to participate effectively.
- **Professionalism:** Present the project in a professional manner that encourages adoption and contribution.

## 2. Problem Statement & User Need

The current project documentation is functional but lacks key information that would improve the experience for both new and existing contributors. Specifically, it is missing instructions for testing GitHub Actions locally, does not provide easy access to the homepages of tools it relies on, and lacks at-a-glance project status indicators.

## 3. Target User Personas

- **New Contributor:** Someone who has just discovered the project and is interested in contributing but needs clear instructions to get started.
- **Existing Contributor:** A developer who is already familiar with the project but needs to work on a new area, such as GitHub Actions, and requires specific guidance.
- **Potential User:** A developer evaluating the project for their own use who needs to quickly assess its health, status, and activity.

## 4. User Stories

- **As a new contributor,** I want to easily understand how to set up my environment and run tests, so that I can start contributing quickly.
- **As a contributor working on GitHub Actions,** I want to know how to test my changes locally, so that I can be confident my changes work before pushing.
- **As a potential user,** I want to see at-a-glance the status and health of the project, so that I can decide if I want to use it.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1. `README.md` Updates

1.  **Add Project Badges:**
    -   A section will be added to the top of the `README.md` to include badges for:
        -   Build Status (GitHub Actions)
        -   License (MIT)
        -   Project Version/Release
        -   Code Quality (linter status)
2.  **Add Dependencies Section:**
    -   A new "Dependencies" section will be added, including:
        -   [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): A high-performance Python package manager.
        -   [poethepoet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet): A versatile task runner for Python projects.
3.  **Add Inline Links:**
    -   All mentions of tools or services (e.g., Gemini CLI, Archon MCP) will be converted to inline Markdown links pointing to their official homepages or repositories.

### 5.2. `docs/contributing.md` Updates

1.  **Add GitHub Actions Testing Guide:**
    -   A new section titled "Testing GitHub Actions Locally" will be added.
    -   This section will provide instructions on how to install and use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act), a tool for running GitHub Actions locally.
2.  **Add Inline Links:**
    -   All mentions of tools (e.g., `uv`, `pre-commit`) will be converted to inline Markdown links.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

-   All documentation must be written in clear, concise, and grammatically correct English.
-   The Markdown formatting must be clean and consistent.

## 7. Success Metrics & KPIs

-   An increase in the number of first-time contributors.
-   Positive feedback from the community on the quality and completeness of the documentation.
-   A reduction in the number of questions related to setup and local testing.

## 8. Risks and Dependencies

-   **Risk:** The homepages or URLs of the tools mentioned may change over time, leading to broken links. (Mitigation: Periodically review and update links.)
-   **Dependency:** The `act` tool requires Docker to be installed, which will be noted in the documentation.

## 9. Out of Scope

-   This PRD does not cover the creation of any new features or functionality within the extension itself.
-   It does not include changes to any other documentation files besides `README.md` and `docs/contributing.md`.
