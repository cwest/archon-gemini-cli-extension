# **Implementation Plan and Requirements Specification for Developer Experience Enhancements**

## **Part I: Developer Experience Enhancements - Requirements Specification**

### **1.0 Strategic Overview & System Vision**

#### **1.1 Project Mandate: Enhancing Developer and Contributor Experience**

The primary objective of this initiative is to refactor and enhance the project to create a more welcoming and efficient environment for developers and contributors. This involves cleaning up the codebase, improving documentation, and introducing modern development tools and practices. The goal is to make the project easier to understand, set up, and contribute to, thereby fostering a healthier and more active open-source community around this Gemini CLI Extension.

### **2.0 Core Principles**

The project will adhere to the following core principles:

1.  **Code Clarity and Simplicity:** The codebase should be easy to understand, with unused or unnecessary files removed.
2.  **Developer Ergonomics:** The development process should be streamlined with the help of modern tooling for task management and automation.
3.  **Comprehensive and User-Centric Documentation:** The project's documentation must be clear, concise, and provide all necessary information for both end-users (Gemini CLI users) and new contributors.
4.  **Code Quality and Consistency:** The project will enforce code quality and consistency through automated checks and linting.

### **3.0 Functional Requirements**

#### **3.1 Codebase Cleanup**

-   **FR-1.1:** Identify and remove unused or extraneous files from the project. This includes, but is not limited to, `main.py`.
-   **FR-1.2:** Review the project structure and reorganize files if necessary to improve clarity and maintainability.

#### **3.2 Developer Tooling**

-   **FR-2.1:** Research and evaluate popular Python task runners and job management tools (e.g., `poethepoet`, `invoke`, `just`) that provide functionality similar to `pnpm run`, `make`, or `rake`.
-   **FR-2.2:** Select and integrate a suitable task runner to provide a consistent developer experience for common tasks such as running the build script (`src/build.py`), running tests, and linting.
-   **FR-2.3:** Document the usage of the chosen task runner in the project's `docs/contributing.md`.

#### **3.3 Documentation Overhaul**

-   **FR-3.1:** Rewrite the `README.md` to adhere to best practices for open-source Gemini CLI Extensions on GitHub.
-   **FR-3.2:** The new `README.md` must be tailored to the Gemini CLI user community and include:
    -   A clear and concise description of the extension's purpose and the Archon workflow it enables.
    -   A "Prerequisites" section detailing the need for the Archon MCP server to be running locally.
    -   Step-by-step installation instructions using the `gemini extensions install` command.
    -   Explicit instructions for configuring the user's `settings.json` to connect to the Archon MCP server.
    -   A comprehensive list of all custom commands provided by the extension (e.g., `/archon:create-plan`, `/archon:execute-plan`) with brief explanations of their function.
    -   A simple "Getting Started" or "Usage" section that walks a user through a typical workflow.
-   **FR-3.3:** Update the `docs/contributing.md` file with detailed instructions on how to set up a local development environment, run tests, configure pre-commit hooks, and test GitHub Actions workflows locally.

#### **3.4 Code Quality and Pre-commit Hooks**

-   **FR-4.1:** Integrate `ruff` for linting and code formatting into the project's pre-commit hooks using the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
-   **FR-4.2:** Configure the `ruff` checks to follow best practices and establish a consistent coding style for the project.
-   **FR-4.3:** Document the pre-commit hook setup and usage in `docs/contributing.md`.

#### **3.5 Documentation Structure and Naming Conventions**

-   **FR-5.1:** Rename the `requirements` directory to `PRDs` to better align with the `PRPs` (Project Requirement Plans) directory, establishing a clear relationship between Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and their corresponding implementation plans.
-   **FR-5.2:** Implement a numbered prefixing scheme for all documents within the `PRDs` and `PRPs` directories to establish a clear chronological order of project development.
-   **FR-5.3:** PRDs shall be prefixed with a two-digit number, starting with `00-`. For example: `00-initial-development.md`.
-   **FR-5.4:** PRPs that correspond to a PRD shall share the same numeric prefix, followed by a letter suffix (a, b, c, etc.) to indicate their sequence. For example, the PRPs for `00-initial-development.md` would be `00a-initial-development.md` and `00b-implement-utility-commands-and-details.md`.
-   **FR-5.5:** The current `developer-experience-enhancements.md` requirements document will be renamed to `01-developer-experience-enhancements.md`.
